Resources for the Monoprice MP Cadet are hard to find. Here is what I've found.

Monoprice does not post updates to Cura very often. Here are a couple of blog posts that discuss modifying newer versions of Cura to work with the MP Cadet.

Mods
* There isn't much you can do to modify/improve the printer. The one thing I did was to remove the metal that blocks the nozzle. I left the part that triggers the z-stop after reading a review of the printer that mentioned doing this.
* If you don't want to buy replacement stickers for the printing surface, I was able to purchase 4" painters tape from Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DKXFAEE


Replacement parts are hard to find. I was able to find some things on Amazon because this is just a rebranded Weedo Tina 2.
